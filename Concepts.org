#+TITLE: Blockchain Concepts

* Distributed systems
** CAP Theorem
States that any distributed system cannot have *Consistency*, *Availability*
and *Partition tolerance* simultaneously.
*** Consistency:
- a property that ensures that all nodes in a distributed systems have a
single latest copy of data.
*** Availability:
- means that a system is up, accesible for use, and is accepting incoming
requests and responding with data without any failures and when required.
*** Partitin Tolerance:
- ensures that if a group of nodes fails the distributed system continues to
operate correctly.

** Byzantine Generals problem
*** Consensus:
- Process of agreement between distrusting nodes on a final state of data.
*** Distributed Consensus:
- The concept of achieving consensus between multiple/distributed nodes.
*** Requirements for consensus mechanisms:
**** Agreement:
- All honest nodes decide on the same value.
**** Termination:
- All honest nodes terminate execution of the consensus process and eventually
reach a decision.
**** Validity:
- The value agreed upon by all honest nodes must be the same as the initial
value proposed by at least one honest node.
**** Fault tolerant:
- The consensus algorithm should be able to run in the presence of faulty or
malicious nodes (Byzantine nodes).
**** Integrity:
- This is a requirement where by no node makes the decision more than once.
The nodes make decisions only once in a single consensus cycle.
*** Types of consensus mechanism
**** Byzantine fault tolerant-based:
- Simple scheme of nodes that are publishing signed messages with no compute
intensive operations. Eventually, when a certain number of messages are received,
then an agreement is reached.
**** Leader-based consensus mechanisms:
- Require nodes to compete for the /leader-election lottery/ and the node that
wins it proposes a final value.

* History of Blockchain
** Eletronic Cash
*** Chaum, Fiat, and Naor (CEN)
- A e-cash scheme that introduced anonimity and double spending detection.
*** Hashcash
- Introduced by Adam Back in 1997 as a Proof of Work system to control email spam.
If legitimate users want to send e-mails then they are required to compute a hash
as a proof that they have spent a reasonable amount of computing resources before
sending the email.
- Takes considerable amount of computing resources to compute but is easy and
quick to verify.
