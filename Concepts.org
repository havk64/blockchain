* Distributed systems
** CAP Theorem
States that any distributed system cannot have *Consistency*, *Availability*
and *Partition tolerance* simultaneously.
*** Consistency:
- a property that ensures that all nodes in a distributed systems have a
single latest copy of data.
*** Availability:
- means that a system is up, accesible for use, and is accepting incoming
requests and responding with data without any failures and when required.
*** Partitin Tolerance:
- ensures that if a group of nodes fails the distributed system continues to
operate correctly.

** Byzantine Generals problem
*** Consensus:
- Process of agreement between distrusting nodes on a final state of data.
*** Distributed Consensus:
- The concept of achieving consensus between multiple/distributed nodes.
*** Consensus mechanisms:
**** Agreement:
**** Termination:
**** Validity:
**** Fault tolerant:
**** Integrity:
